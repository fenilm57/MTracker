        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 11, 2025
      </div>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to MTracker ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains
        how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you
        use our mobile application MTracker (the "App"). Please read this
        Privacy Policy carefully.
      </p>

      <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> By using our App, you consent to the data
        practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with this
        policy, please do not use our App.
      </div>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        MTracker is designed as a local expense tracking application. We do not
        collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external
        servers. All data remains on your device.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We do not collect usage data, analytics, or tracking information from
        the App.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Device Information</h3>
      <p>
        The App may access device features necessary for functionality, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Local storage for saving your expense data</li>
        <li>
          Camera (if you choose to add photos to transactions - feature may be
          added in future updates)
        </li>
        <li>File system access for PDF export functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your financial data never leaves your device</li>
        <li>We cannot access your transaction information</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to our servers or third parties</li>
        <li>All processing happens locally on your device</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>
      <p>
        All your data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database.
        This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transaction records (income and expenses)</li>
        <li>Categories and descriptions</li>
        <li>Dates and amounts</li>
        <li>Any other data you input into the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        While we implement reasonable security measures within the App, the
        security of your data also depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your device's security settings</li>
        <li>Physical access to your device</li>
        <li>Your device's operating system security</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with
        third parties because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not have access to your data</li>
        <li>All data remains on your device</li>
        <li>No data transmission occurs to external servers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

        or advertising networks. The App operates independently without external
        connections.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under 13 years of age. Since all data is stored locally and we have no
        access to user data, we cannot determine the age of our users.
      </p>
